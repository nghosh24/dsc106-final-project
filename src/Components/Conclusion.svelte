    Our interactive visualizations have provided some information about the hurricanes that affected
    North America from 2000 to 2023. In 2020, there were a record number of hurricanes, 
    highlighted by the red colored bar in the bar chart. Our map also shows the areas that are most affected by these storms. This provides 
    important information since some places are at a higher risk for more severe storms,
    which can help people plan where to direct resources in the case of an emergency. The maps
    display an important takeaway, that hurricanes seem to hit the same overlapping area. 
    This would be difficult to see just from data on a spreadsheet, since geographic data is best
    understood when visualized. Our interactive map allows the user to toggle which hurricanes are displayed,
    so they can easily determine which areas are at the highest risk of being struck by hurricanes. 
    Hopefully, seeing the true magnitude of hurricanes damages will inspire us to collectively 
    combat climate change so the planet will experience less frequent and intense hurricanes.
