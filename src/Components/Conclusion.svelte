    Our visualizations have provided some information about the hurricanes that affected
    North America from 2000 to 2023. In 2020, there were a record number of hurricanes. 
    Our map also shows the areas that are most affected by these storms. This provides 
    important information since some places are at a higher risk for more severe storms,
    which can help people plan where to direct resources in the case of an emergency.
    Hopefully, we will be able to collectively combat climate change so that we experience
    less frequent and intense hurricanes.
