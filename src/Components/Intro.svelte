    Climate change is one of the most pressing global problems, resulting in higher
    temperates and more extreme weather events across the entire planet. One of the most
    damaging weather events is hurricanes, which can destroy people's homes, livelihoods,
    and take countless lives. We decided to do an investigation into the trends of 
    hurricanes in North America from 2000 to 2023 to better understand the characteristics
    and impacts of the most damaging hurricanes.
